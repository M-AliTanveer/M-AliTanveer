## Hello and Welcome to Muhammad Ali's Personal Profile ðŸ‘‹

- :mortar_board: I graduated *Summa cum laude* in **Bachelors in Computer Sceinces(BSCS)** from **FAST NUCES Karachi** in 2023.
- :man_technologist: I am an experienced C++ Games Developer with expertise in Unreal Engine
- :open_book: I have keen interest in Gameplay Programming, AI Programming in Games and Game Design.

If you don't see a lot of commits here, that's because of 2 reasons:
1) My organization makes me use a separate work account.
2) I generally use Perforce as a VCS, and then upload the projects here later on.

## My Projects
#### 1. [Into The Mystic](https://github.com/M-AliTanveer/Into-The-Mystic): 
"Into the Mystic" is a first-person shooter game that incorporates puzzle-solving and non-Euclidean geometry to create a unique gaming experience. This Final Year Project (FYP) experiments with the gimmicks in order to evaluate how these gimmicks can be utilized so that the gameplay progression feels smooth while also providing engaging gameplay.  The game uses the Unity3D engine and innovative gameplay mechanics to keep players engaged. The story revolves around humanoid androids solving test chambers to prove they can assimilate with humanity. You can read more about it [here](https://github.com/M-AliTanveer/Into-The-Mystic)
#### 2. [VR Bowling (Prototype)](https://github.com/M-AliTanveer/VRBowling): 
This project is a prototype VR bowling game for Quest 2 that features multiplayer PvP gameplay. The game allows players to compete against each other in a realistic bowling alley environment, with physics-based ball and pin interactions. The game also supports voice chat, so players can communicate and trash talk during their turns. I used EOS for the multiplayer networking and Unreal Engine as the engine for this prototype.

### Semester Projects
#### 3. [Mordecai(FLEX 2.0)](https://github.com/M-AliTanveer/Mordecai): 
A clone of my university's Student Portal named FLEX. It was developed completely using C language and we developed extra features besides the one found in the official university's portal. The project itself had two separaate sections for the teacher and the students linked together to create a seamless University Portal To get more info about the project, its working and how it was developed, check out the repository [here](https://github.com/M-AliTanveer/Mordecai).
#### 4. [Nova DetectCam](https://github.com/T-Zaid/Nova-DetectCam):
A Deep Learning project which Utilizes [MediaPipe by Google](https://google.github.io/mediapipe) to track, model and stylyze the user's face. 
The Project has 2 separate models working together. The Face model by MediaPipe and the Hand model by MediaPipe. 
We set up the Hand model to track any movement done by the user's hands and for any gestures they perform, we have set up actions ranging from applying filters on the face of the person to controlling system acions such as screenshot taking and volume increasing.
The Gestures activate the Filter Placement algorithm, both of which extensively work on landmark coordinates to ensure accuracy of work.
#### 5. [Grammar Corrector and Dictionary](https://github.com/M-AliTanveer/Grammar-Corrector):
This is a Grammar Corrector and Dictionary that me and my friends developed for our Data Structures project. The program makes use of basic **Natural Language Processing** I learned on my own within a limited timeframe. The program corrects errors in helping verb placement within a sentence and works for all tenses of the English Language. The UI was developed in Windows Forms to provide a complete and seamless GUI. Check the repository [here](https://github.com/M-AliTanveer/Grammar-Corrector) for more info about the project.
#### 6. [Full University Preparation Assistant](https://github.com/M-AliTanveer/FUPA):
A program to create and take quizzes under time constraints to prepare students for university entrance tests. It assists both students and teachers. This project is created in Intel x8086 assembly language using MASM assembler. Irvine's Library was used in the project as well as a set of Windows specific functions to enable clicking in the console for a partial GUI feel. Check out the repository [here](https://github.com/M-AliTanveer/FUPA).
#### 7. [Zephyr II: Numerical Computing and Analysis ](https://github.com/M-AliTanveer/Zephyr-2.0-Parallelized):
A GUI-based Parallel program developed completely in C++ with the use of OpenMP parallel directives. It Updates on the prior <a href="https://github.com/Fawad-Javed-Fateh/Zephyr-I">Python Script Zephyr I</a> with more updated and streamlined methodologies and parallelism based approach.
